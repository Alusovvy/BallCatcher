# BallCatcher

This is a simple C++ game project with addition of SFML library that allows to draw sprites and shapes. As one of my first game project, this is a "playaround" with collision, game loop and simple game logic. Player can collect points by collding with green balls that are appearing on the screen at random and player has to avoid red balls that are going into his direction and can steal player's score.
